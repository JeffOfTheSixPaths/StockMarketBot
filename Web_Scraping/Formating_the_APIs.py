    for the for loop below:

    we assign the current month to a dataframe and then sort that dataframe by the publish date.

    we then go through each publish date and remove the T00:00:00 from them (for example 2022-08-01T00:00:00 to 2022-08-01).
    we now go through each article individually and add their keys to a dictionary article_dictionary which will later be used to be appended into days_to_articles.
    continuing to go through each individual article, we add the publish date to the dictionary days_to_articles. if the publish date is not there it adds an empty
    list as its value. the article (article_dictionary) is then appended to that list.
    ^is continued for all the articles and then saved as a json.
